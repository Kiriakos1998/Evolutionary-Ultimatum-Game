# First model simulate the evolution of a N size population where all players play against all the others and compete for all positions to leave offsprings.
# Second model introduce the concept of neighbor so each player competes only with some other players close to him and also competes for only these places.
# Third model is same as second but can run using gpuArray.
# Fourth model introduce a 2-d neighbor where players can play only with thoses directly left right up and down from them. 
# Fifth model is the same with fourth but is using gpuArrays.
# Sixth model is visualising the invasion of a small group of stategies let it be S1 to a sea of strategies S2 as it concerns the Fourth model.
# Seventh model is visualising the invansion of a small group os strategies let it be S1 to a sea of strategies S2 as it concerns the Second model.
